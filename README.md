`index.html`

`styles` folder -> `main.css` and `font-awesome-4.7.0` folder

It is a responsive cross platform website that provides some info about me like education, skills, my CV, likes/hobbies and contact information.

I used HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript to create this website. It is a single page website. You can naigate between the 4 available sections by clicking the respective one on navigation bar(Home, About, Skills, Contact) which will load that particular section's data.
